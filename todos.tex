\section{TODOs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Results of \Secref{sec:exp:sym_teacher} -  this experiment should be
    based on GD, not Adam
    \item Would be better if state space dimensions for student and teacher in all experiments would be identical.
    \item Improve figures, e.g.:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Reduce height (i.e.~make figures shorter)
    \item Increase axis label font size
    \item Change "Sequence Length" to "Training Sequence Length"
    \item Add axis labels to Figure~2(b)
    \item Tighten axis limits (e.g.~no need for negative y values in Figure~1 and negative x values in Figure~2(b))
    \item In Figure~2(b), replace~$k$ by~$k_g$, or better yet, by "training sequence length"
    \end{itemize}
    \item Would be nicer if number of seeds was the same as across all experiments.
    \item \st{Capitalize references to equations (i.e.~have "Equation X" instead of "equation X")}
    \item \st{Use "Appendix" (rather than "Section") in references to supplementary material}
    \item Add Wasserstein distance to \Secref{sec:setup}.
    \item Add $\odot$ to denote Hadamard product.
\end{itemize}
